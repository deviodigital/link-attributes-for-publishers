Automatically add sponsored, ugc and nofollow `rel` tags to specific URL's in your content

== Description ==

This plugin will automatically update the rel tags for links with specific domains in the classic editor content, and the new core block editor.

The **Link Attributes for Publishers** plugin is designed to assist content authors in complying with Google's suggestions regarding proper tagging of sponsored and user-generated content (UGC) links. This plugin simplifies the process of adding rel tags for sponsored, ugc, and nofollow links to ensure your website meets Google's specifications for link attribution.

### Who is this for?

This plugin is particularly useful for:

*   Content Authors: Easily add `rel` tags to links without the need for manual coding.
*   Publishers: Ensure all sponsored and user-generated content links are properly tagged for compliance.

Let's say you want to mark all **amzn.to** links as `sponsored` because they're all affiliate links. This plugin helps you do that automatically to all content, old and new.

### Features

*   Automatically sets `rel` tags for sponsored, ugc, and nofollow links.
*   Allows users to specify domain names for automatic `rel` tag addition.
*   Simplifies compliance with Google's specifications about link attributes.
